.. note::

  The configuration page of this module is available only in the old Server Manager.

The :index:`SNMP` (Simple Network Management Protocol) protocol allows to manage and monitor devices connected to the network.
The `SNMP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol>`_ server can reply to specific queries about current system status.

The server is disabled by default.

To enable it, you should set three main options:

* the SNMP community name
* the location name where the server is located
* the name and email address of system administrator

The implementation is based on the Net-SNMP project. Please refer to the official project page for more information:
