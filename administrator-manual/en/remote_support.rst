This chapter describes how to activate remote support for NethServer Enterprise 6.x e 7.x.
The procedure for NethSever Enterprise to initiate a NethSOS session is the following:

1. go to the server manager page of NethServer on port 980 and click on the "Remote support" item on the left column
2. click on the "START SESSION" button to enable remote support
3. send the Session identifier to Nethesis helpdesk representative


.. note:: If the "Remote support" item on the left column is not present, please execute the command `"yum clean all && yum update -y"` and then refresh the server-manager page.
