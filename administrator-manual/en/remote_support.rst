This chapter describes how to activate remote support for NethServer Enterprise 6.x e 7.x.
The procedure for NethSever Enterprise to initiate a NethSOS session is the following:

1. go to the server manager page of NethServer on port 980 and click on the "Remote support" item on the left column
2. clicking on the "Start" button a session id will be generated
3. communicate the generated session id to the support via a ticket


.. note:: If the "Remote support" item on the left column is not present, please execute the command `"yum clean all && yum update -y"` and then refresh the server-manager page.
