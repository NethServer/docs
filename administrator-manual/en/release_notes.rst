* The new Server Manager implementation based on Cockpit is now marked as stable

* On new installations, the :guilabel:`System > Settings > Shell policy > Override the shell of users` option is enabled by default.
  Normal users will be able to log in to the new Server Manager only if :guilabel:`System > Settings > User settings page > Enable user settings page` option has been enabled, or if the user has been
  delegated to access at least one module.

  SSH access is limited to ``root`` and users inside the designated administrative group (``Domain Admins`` by default). More granular permissions can be tuned from the :guilabel:`SSH` page.

* All IMAP actions will be logged by default into ``/var/log/imap``

* Shared seen flag is enabled by default for shared mail folders

* Mail server connection limit for each user has been increased to avoid errors on web mail clients

* OpenVPN roadwarrior server will use the ``subnet`` `topology <https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Topology>`_ as default

  match between user name and certificate CN

* Default maximum PHP memory size has been increased from 128MB to 512MB

* Nextcloud now uses PHP 7.3 stack to improve performance and support widely used plugins

* Ejabberd has been upgraded to 20.03

* POP3 proxy (P3Scan) has been deprecated and can't be installed anymore from Software Center

---------------------------

  Server Manager module from the Software Center page.  See also
  :ref:`access2-section`.

* The :guilabel:`Software updates origin` (locked/unlocked) feature was removed
  from the "Software Center" page. |product| can be upgraded manually
  from the Software Center page when the next "point release" is released. See
  also :ref:`software-center-section`.

  available from YUM repositories

  feature :guilabel:`Shared mailboxes` has been renamed to :guilabel:`Public

  granting IMAP access to the root user; further permissions can be added from the
  new Server Manager Email application or with an IMAP/ACL client, like Roundcube.

* Only users with enabled shell can access the new Server Manager.
  From the old Server Manager, go to the :guilabel:`Users and groups` page and enable
  the :guilabel:`Remote shell (SSH)` option for the selected user.

  the :guilabel:`Shell` option for the selected user.

      locally. In that case an ``.rpmnew`` file is created instead of overwriting
      the local changes. Rename the ``.rpmnew`` to ``.repo`` to apply the new
      defaults. This is the list of files to be checked:

        - :file:`/etc/nethserver/yum-update.d/NsReleaseLock.repo`
