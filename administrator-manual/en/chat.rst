====

The :index:`chat` service uses the standard protocol :index:`Jabber`/:index:`XMPP` and support TLS on standard ports (5222 or 5223).

* Transfer files over LAN 

All system users can access the chat using their own credentials.

.. note::       If |product| is bound to a remote Active Directory account provider
                a dedicated user account in AD is required by the module to be fully
                operational! See :ref:`join-existing-ad-section`.

======

Jabber clients are available for all desktop and mobile platforms. 

Some widespread clients:

When you configure the client, make sure TLS (or SSL) is enabled.
Enter the user name and the domain of the machine. 

If |product| is also the DNS server of the network, the client should automatically find the server's address through special 
pre-configured DNS records. Otherwise, specify the server address in the advanced options.

Administrators can:
