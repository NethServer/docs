"Fail2ban scans log files (e.g. :file:`/var/log/apache/error_log`) and bans "
"IPs that show the malicious signs â€“ too many password failures, seeking for "
"exploits, etc. Generally Fail2ban is then used to update firewall rules to "
"reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of time, although any "
"arbitrary other action (e.g. sending an email) could also be configured. Out"
" of the box Fail2ban comes with filters for various services (Apache, "
"Dovecot, Ssh, Postfix, etc)."
