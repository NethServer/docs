======================
|product| subscription
======================

A |product| installation can be registered to a public or private Dartagnan [#Dartagnan]_ instance,
getting access to monitoring portal and stable update repositories.

.. hint::

    The |product| Subscription by Nethesis [#Nethesis]_ enables access to a
    public ready-to-use Dartagnan instance, along with immediate professional
    support services for your |product| deployments. Detailed info available at
    https://my.nethserver.com


Activating a subscription will enable the stable YUM repositories, but will
disable any other repositories you may have added. You can re-enable any other
repositories by creating a "template-custom" for
:file:`/etc/nethserver/eorepo.conf`.

The subscription provider may not accept support requests for the contents of
custom repositories.
