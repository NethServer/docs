Subscription
============

A |product| installation can be registered to a public or private Dartagnan [#Dartagnan]_ instance,
getting access to monitoring portal and stable update repositories.

.. hint::

    The |product| Subscription by Nethesis [#Nethesis]_ enables access to a
    public ready-to-use Dartagnan instance, along with immediate professional
    support services for your |product| deployments. Detailed info available at
    https://my.nethserver.com


Activating a subscription will enable the stable YUM repositories, but will
disable any other repositories you may have added. You can re-enable any other
repository by setting the ``ExtraRepositories`` property from the command line.
The property accepts a comma-separated list of repository names and it is case sensitive. Example: ::

  config setprop subscription ExtraRepositories nethforge,repositoryB
  signal-event software-repos-save

The subscription provider may not accept support requests for the contents of
custom repositories.
